# Bridge Design Pattern in C# Implementation


Let us build a .NET Core C# console application to implement the Bridge Design Pattern using a very simple requirement. The requirement of the application is defined as follows:

## Requirement Description

A client processes employee salary details and want to save the processed data to an XML or a JSON file. The saving of data to a specific file format will be decided during the runtime and the client can introduce other formats in the near future. The salary processing remains the same and wonâ€™t change, but the file format can vary.
